Public Defensive Publication establishing prior art for the In-Core system class.  This repository intentionally discloses normative boundaries while omitting proprietary mechanisms.
# In-Core — Public Defensive Publication (v1.1)

This repository contains a **Public Defensive Publication** establishing **prior art** for the *In-Core* system class.

The purpose of this publication is **defensive**:
to ensure that the described class of systems, including its obvious variants, **cannot be patented or exclusively claimed by third parties**.

---

## Purpose

This publication discloses the **normative boundaries, structural principles, and functional class** of the In-Core system, while **intentionally omitting all proprietary mechanisms, calibration logic, and implementation details**, which are protected as trade secrets.

The disclosure is sufficient to establish prior art without enabling replication.

---

## System Class Overview

*In-Core* represents a distinct class of systems characterized by the following properties:

- **Non-optimizing architecture**  
  The system explicitly rejects performance maximization, engagement optimization, and outcome-driven scoring.

- **Normative constraint system**  
  Behavior is governed by explicit constraints rather than adaptive optimization loops.

- **Agency-preserving design**  
  The system introduces supraliminal positive friction to prevent automatic compliance and preserve human agency.

- **Absence of outcome feedback**  
  No reinforcement signals, reward metrics, or behavioral scoring are generated or consumed.

- **Explicit rejection of engagement metrics**  
  The system does not track, optimize, or respond to engagement, retention, or attention metrics.

- **Apophatic / non-directive interaction mode**  
  The system operates without prescriptive guidance, instructions, or goal imposition.

- **Local-first operation**  
  Core functionality does not depend on centralized data aggregation or cloud-based optimization.

- **Optional Living Flow Engine (Gaia)**  
  A subsystem oriented toward restoring rhythm, sufficiency, and balanced exchange rather than accumulation or maximization.

## Scope of Disclosure

This repository intentionally discloses:

- the **existence** of the system class  
- its **normative boundaries**  
- its **architectural posture**  
- its **design exclusions**

This repository intentionally withholds:

- implementation mechanisms  
- calibration parameters  
- internal logic flows  
- algorithms, models, or training procedures  
- any data schemas or operational thresholds  

These elements remain protected as **trade secrets**.

---

## Legal Intent

This publication is made with explicit intent to:

- establish **public prior art**
- prevent third-party patent claims on the disclosed system class
- preserve freedom to operate for the original author and aligned implementations

No license is granted.
No permission for implementation is implied.

## Status

- Publication type: Public Defensive Publication  
- Version: v1.1  
- Date of publication: 2026-01-30
