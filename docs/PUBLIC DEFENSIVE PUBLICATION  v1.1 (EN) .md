## **1\) Purpose**

This document is a **public defensive publication** intended to establish **prior art**.  
 It discloses the **In-Core system class**, its **architectural and normative boundaries**, and **representative elements** in order to reduce the ability of third parties to patent this class of solutions and obvious variants.

This publication **intentionally omits** implementation details including (without limitation): parameters, thresholds, weights, formulas, calibration methods, internal procedures, and exact decision algorithms. Such elements may constitute **know-how / trade secrets**.

---

## **2\) Class definition**

**In-Core** is a class of **normative middleware** designed to **preserve and restore human agency** in digital and hybrid environments.

The system functions as a **regulator of interaction conditions**, supporting conscious choice through **supraliminal positive friction** and **local-first constraints**, while explicitly rejecting:

* engagement and retention goals,

* behavioral optimization goals,

* metric growth goals,

* outcome-driven “improvement” goals.

---

## **3\) Key public definitions**

**Agency:** the capacity to act beyond automaticity through a conscious act of choice.

**Center / Pause:** the critical temporal interval between stimulus and response in which choice is possible.

**Supraliminal Positive Friction:** changes to interaction conditions that are within the range of conscious perceivability (not subliminal manipulation), supporting pause and reducing automaticity without imposing a specific choice.

**Local-first:** core operation does not require cloud services; the system avoids exporting sensitive behavioral data and does not build external user profiles.

---

## **4\) Publicly disclosed In-Core elements (prior art)**

### **4.1) In-Core as a Non-Optimizing System**

In-Core is **not intended** to optimize the user, the user’s behavior, or time-in-product.  
 It is **not designed** for engagement, retention, metric growth, or productivity maximization.

---

### **4.2) Explicit rejection of engagement metrics**

In-Core does **not** use or optimize engagement metrics (e.g., session length, retention, DAU/MAU) or proxy “success” metrics.

If any local observations exist, they serve **only** a **local regulation of interaction conditions**, without external “improvement” objectives and without engagement KPIs.

---

### **4.3) Absence of outcome feedback**

In-Core does **not** provide:

* scores,

* ratings,

* achievements,

* rewards,

* measurable “progress/success” outcomes,

* “right/wrong” behavioral evaluations.

The system avoids reinforcement mechanics and does not create dependence on evaluative feedback.

---

### **4.4) Apophatic / Non-Directive Mode**

In-Core may include a mode in which the system intentionally withholds:

* recommendations (“what to do”),

* user goals,

* directive instructions,

* “correct answers,”

* evaluative or motivational feedback.

The system may adjust **conditions**, but does not impose **direction**, in order to avoid substituting the user’s agency.

---

### **4.5) Positive Friction Middleware**

In-Core discloses a class in which **positive friction** is implemented as a **middleware layer of interaction conditions**.

Class properties:

* friction is **supraliminal** (not subliminal),

* friction is **not hidden manipulation**,

* friction **does not impose a specific choice**,

* friction supports **pause** and reduces automaticity.

This publication discloses the **class**, not a specific implementation.

---

### **4.6) In-Core Gaia / Living Flow Engine (normative living-flow loop)**

In-Core may include an optional normative layer referred to as **In-Core Gaia / the Living Flow Engine**, intended to:

* reduce misalignment with natural and social rhythms,

* reduce attention leakage,

* restore the “take–give” reciprocity cycle,

* support a state of sufficiency rather than maximization.

Gaia is **not** an ESG module, sustainability metric, recommender, behavioral optimizer, or “value-aligned AI.”  
 Gaia introduces **no goals** and provides **no outcome feedback**.  
 Gaia functions as a **normative admissibility layer** under which the system may slow down, refuse, or withdraw interventions when flow coherence and reciprocity/sufficiency constraints are violated.

---

## **5\) In-Core Rig (optional physical interface layer)**

The In-Core architecture may optionally include a physical interface layer (“In-Core Rig”) extending the same agency-preserving principles into hybrid or off-screen scenarios.

The Rig introduces no profiling, KPI monitoring, engagement objectives, or external optimization and does not alter the normative nature of the In-Core class.

---

## **6\) Disclosure principle: “published as a class, not disclosed as a mechanism”**

This publication discloses:

* the system class,

* architectural boundaries,

* normative constraints and prohibitions,

while intentionally omitting:

* parameters, formulas, weights, thresholds,

* calibration procedures,

* exact decision algorithms,

* internal cross-loop coordination methods.

---

## **7\) Exclusions (what In-Core is not)**

In-Core is not persuasive technology/nudging, not subliminal manipulation, not an engagement product, not a tracker/profiler, not coaching/therapy, and not a KPI-driven behavior improvement system.
